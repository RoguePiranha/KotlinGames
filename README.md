# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to continuously expand my knowledge and skills in various programming languages and paradigms. Kotlin, being a modern programming language, offers a lot of features that make it a great choice for a variety of applications, from Android development to web servers. To further my understanding of Kotlin, I developed a simple game application.

The software I wrote is a game application that includes two text-based mini-games: "Guess the Number" and "Dual Dice Duel". The application is built using Kotlin and Swing, a Java library for creating graphical user interfaces. The application features a user-friendly interface where players can choose a game, place bets, and play the games. The application also keeps track of the player's coin balance and displays game rules in a separate window.

There were a few reasons that I chose to make this Kotlin project. Firstly, it allowed me to explore and understand various aspects of Kotlin, which is an entirely new language for me. Secondly, it helped me to get my foot in the door for working with mobile app development. Lastly, the project served as a practical exercise in software design and problem-solving, as I had to devise the game logic and implement it in code. Through this project, I was able to gain hands-on experience with Kotlin and further develop my programming skills.

# Development Environment

The only tool I really used for this project was IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition as well as installing the later version of JDK.

The language I used for this project is Kotlin. It's a language developed by JetBrains. It's designed to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but it can also be compiled to JavaScript or native code. It's got a lot of cool features that make it more concise and safer than Java.

For this project, I didn't need to use any external libraries. Everything I needed was already included in the standard Kotlin library and the Java standard library. For the graphical user interface, I used Swing, which is a part of Java's standard library. It's a bit old school, but it gets the job done for simple applications like this one.

# Future Work

- Add more games. There are a lot of simple games that could be included here, that also means I would need to update the UI to be able to incorporate them all without having the screen be cluttered.
- Add a leaderboard feature to keep track of high scores to give a little more weight to the games.
- Improve the UI. I want to make this game hub a lot cleaner and more modern looking. It looks straight out of Windows XP for the moment.
